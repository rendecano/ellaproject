		During the Islamic Golden Age, certain advances were made in scientific fields, notably in mathematics and astronomy (algebra, spherical trigonometry), and in chemistry, etc. which were later also transmitted to the West. Stefan of Pise translated into Latin around 1127 an Arab manual of medical theory.	
		<br/><br/>
		From the dawn of Islam, Muslim scholars have made significant contributions to the world of learning. Indeed, from the 7th Century until the 15th Century, Muslims were the torchbearers of human civilisation. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe fell into the Dark Ages but Muslim scholars succeeded in preserving the classical wisdom of Ancient Greece and Rome. Due to their thirst for knowledge Muslims then went on to make spectacular advances in a wide spectrum of subjects, including mathematics, astronomy, geography, medicine, physics, chemistry, biology, botany, and veterinary science. Believing in the unity behind creation, many Muslim scholars recognised the close affinity between academic disciplines, and it was not unusual for a physician to also be an accomplished mathematician, philosopher or astronomer. Scholarship at the height of Muslim civilisation succeeded in combining the energies and genius of people from all over the known-world. In many Muslim cities, there was truly an international citizenry. The interaction between so many people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds was facilitated by Muslims’ sense of hospitality and tolerance of other ways of life.
		<br/><br/>
		After nearly 900 years of intellectual leadership, however, internal bickering and complacency saw the influence of Muslims stagnate and then decline
		<br/><br/>
		It would, nevertheless, be true to say that advances made by Muslim scholars from such seats of learning as Baghdad, Muslim Spain and Cairo laid the foundations for Europe’s ‘Renaissance’ [intellectual re-awakening] in the Middle Ages. This, in turn, fuelled the Industrial Revolution that has eventually given rise to the scientific and technical achievements of today.

						The numbers we use today (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 0) are called Arabic numbers. Learned from the Indians, Muslim mathematicians brought them to Europe around the 12th Century which revolutionised the study of mathematics and science. This much easier system replaced the cumbersome Roman numeral system which did not have a symbol for zero.  ‘Algebra’ was invented by the Muslim mathematician, Muhammad Abu Musa Al-Khwarizmi [780-850] His book entitled ‘Hisabal-jabr wa’l-Muqabala’ was translated into latin in the 12th Century and was the most important mathematical text in Europe for the next 400 years.  The well-known formula of trigonometry was laid down
						by Abu’l-Wana Buzjani [died 940].

						<b>The first scientist to identify measles was Al-Razi of Persia [Iran] [824-932]. </b>Known to the West as Rhazes, he was also the first to divide chemical substances into groups, termed mineral, vegetable and animal. He wrote extensively about philosophical and medical matters. His works were translated into Latin, influencing European physicians and scholars through The Middle Ages.	
						<br/><br>
						<b>The standard book of medicine in Europe for 500 years was written by Ibn Sina [980-1037].</b> Born in Bukhara in Turkestan in Central Asia, Ibn Sina became known in Europe as Avicenna and also as the ‘Prince of Physicians’, and is remembered as the greatest Muslim physician. His comprehensive book ‘the Canon of Medicine’ [which contained over a million words] was translated into Latin and used in European universities until the 17th Century as a standard medical text.

						<b>The pulmonary circulation system [the minor circulation of blood] was first discovered by Ibn an-Nafis of Damascus and Cairo [1210-1298].</b> He explained how blood is pumped from the heart to the lungs, where it absorbs oxygen, and then travels back to the heart and thereafter releases the oxygen in the upper part of the body.

						<b>The first hospital in the world for people suffering from mental illness</b> was established in Baghdad in 765.

						Muslims ruled most of Spain [al Andalus] for nearly 800 years [from 711 to 1492] during which time great scientific and technical advances were made. 
						<br><br>
						Whilst London was largely a settlement of ramshackle buildings, the city of Cordoba [the capital of Muslim Spain] had street lighting, pavements, public baths and public libraries. This was a time in which Muslim, Jew and Christian lived and worked side by side; scholars from all over Europe and beyond travelled to study at the universities of Cordoba, Seville, Malaga and Granada. Architecture in Spain at this time flourished, with notable examples being the mosque of Cordoba, and the Al Hambra Palace in Granada.

						An advanced understanding of astronomy helped Muslims to develop the astrolobe, a precision-made instrument used in navigation, which measured the altitude of stars.
						<br><br>
						<b>Muslims were great explorers, travellers and merchants.</b> Helped by navigational instruments such as the astrolabe, men such as Ibn Battuta travelled across the known world, making extensive journeys to Africa, India, China and beyond. Not only did Muslims bring back valuable silks and spices and other precious goods, they also acquired scientific and technical knowledge which they later made accessible to Europe.
