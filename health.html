<b><font face="COPPER BLACK" size="+3" color="RED">HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF GENDER AND HUMAN SEXUALITY</b></font>
<hr>

	In the early 7th century up to the present day, women have played a vital role in shaping Islamic history.  However, their voices have often been left out of standard historical narratives, silenced by a lack of primary sources as well as an assumed belief by male historians that they were not part of the development of Islamic civilizations. Looking past this bias, scholars may find many valuable sources to uncover the significant contributions of women to Islamic history, revealing their work alongside men throughout the centuries.	
	<br/><br/>
	Cultural traditions often impact gender roles, prevailing cultural norms, and the interpretation of the Quran and other Islamic texts.  Sexuality as discussed in Islamic texts is generally confined to the context of heterosexual marriage, and in all cases, modesty and chastity are strongly encouraged. Pre-marital sex and same gender sex are forbidden, and abortion is largely discouraged except in cases where there are medical risks for the mother. Sexuality in Islam is often separated in terms of male versus female sexuality, marital versus pre-marital versus extramarital sexuality, and heterosexuality versus homosexuality as is pointed out by Abdessamad Dialmy.

		<hr>
		Islam  addresses  gender  issues  as  the  coexistence  of  two  equal  partners,  inwhich each partner complements the other. It is not strange that the Islamic pointof view contains some points of inequality between male and female, since thereare natural and psycho-cognitive differences between genders. There is differencein  natural  identity,  bodily  delicacy,  sexual  urge  and  reaction,  functions  andimplications of reproduction, and hormones. There is also disparity in the abilityto influence others, in the response to stimuli, flexibility, degree of dependency,interest  to  surrender,  receptiveness,  and  concentration.

		<hr>
		Islam does not discriminate between human beings on the basis of gender, anddifferent functions in life does not mean the elevation or relegation of one or theother sex. There are general rights for living in dignity, the rights to have lifeprovision  and  the  social  and  civil  rights.  As  man  has  the  right  to  choose  hisfuture partner, Islam gives woman the right to choose her own life partner. “Thewoman  that  is  to  remarry  shall  not  be  engaged  until  she  approves  it,  and  thevirgin girl shall not be given out in marriage until she allows.” (al-Bukhari, hadithno.  4741)  The  Prophet  was  reported  to  have  given  back  the  right  to  choosehusband to a girl who complained that her father forced her into a marriage.
